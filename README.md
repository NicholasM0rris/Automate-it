So you have difficult sound accoustics online assignments problems... You could either *actually* learn the content, 
or you could play around, have some fun and develop a program to automate it for you... 

As a developer the choice is obvious, right!?

```automate_it.py ``` has a gui interface for selecting your parameters, such as giving login details, how 
which questions to do and how to approach them. It will automatically log into the website, navigate to the 
correct question, and begin brute force guessing the answer. It will scrape the result, and keep guessing
until it finds the answer, or is stopped. Once the answer is found, it will stop and save the answer.

It was a fun experiment designing a gui, and scraping and manipulating a webbrowser with selenium, however 
it also works like a charm!
